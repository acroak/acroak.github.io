The logic was written with the goal to display two sperate hands, a player and a dealer, to take bets from the players bank or add winnings, and to evaluate if the sum of the card values in each hand are less than, equal to or greater than 21.\

Unsolved problems: on occasion the logic will draw an undefined card. I wanted the cards to slightly overlap like a fan rather than be displayed in a grid. The chips aren't perfectly centered and I can not track down why. I also researched how to lock certain functionality until a certain action is completed, ie place a bet and then be able to deal, and once the round has started lock the chips. But it kept breaking my game. Should I have added media queries to handle font sizes?
